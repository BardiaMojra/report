\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
  \item DLO Dataset (\textcolor{red}{RAL}): Last week, I moved DLO data collection
  parts to UTARI and set up the test rig. Today, I collected multiple DLO manipulation
  test episodes. This week, I will work on DLO data extraction and the method
  section of the paper.   \\
  \item Maicol: \\
  \item DLO Manipulation (\textcolor{red}{IROS}): \cite{abraham2017model}.\\
  \item XEst (\textcolor{red}{RAL ---}): No update.\\
  \end{itemize}

\section{Research Plan}
This section outlines my current research plan for the next 3 months, 6 months,
and 1 year. Moreover, I have included open projects and ideas to keep track of
them.\\
Target conferences: ICRA, IROS (March), CASE (Late Feb.), NIPS.\\
Target Journals: RAL, CVPR, CORAL.\\

\subsection{Research Plan:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{3 months:} The primary objective will be to publish the DLO dataset paper,
  (\textcolor{red}{DLO-1}),
  finished my classes, and to meet my next Ph.D. milestone, the comprehensive exam.
  My goal is to submit the DLO dataset paper to IROS by March 1st.\
  \item \textbf{6 months:} Next, I want to explore using DMD as a method to retrieve the
  correct Quaternion solution for the QuEst method, (\textcolor{red}{QuEst-01}).
  I believe this testing this
  is fairly fast and I should be able to publish that paper fairly quickly. I
  believe the RAL would be an appropriate journal to target; we can discuss
  this further with Dr. Gans to get his input.\
  \item \textbf{1 year:} Next, I want to focus on (\textcolor{red}{PIKO-01}) as a method
  for fast online system identification. My aim is to confirm this method by
  comparing it against existing Koopman-based methods. In the following work, I
  will extend this method to control DLOs in real time (\textcolor{red}{DLO-02}).\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Pipeline:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item DLO-01 (\textcolor{red}{IROS - March 1st, 2023}):
  DLO manipulation dataset with DLO configuration and gripper pose, as well
  as the gripper control input. Ideally, UR5 back-EMF current and bus voltage
  should be recorded. A DLO mount is introduced. A method for configuration
  estimation is introduced. Perhaps, a method for learning DLO dynamic can be
  trained and introduced.\
  \item QuEst-01 (\textcolor{red}{IROS}):
  Optimal transform solution for QuEst based on dominant mode decomposition (DMD).
  \item PIKO-01 (\textcolor{red}{TBD}):
  This work leverages DMD and Physics-Informed machine learning to extract
  low-dimensional coherent modal structures from dynamic data. This method
  will extend DMD-based approaches to include mixed basis functions. Moreover,
  this method will automatically try to find the best fit at a specified range
  of ranks. This method will be validated by comparing it against the existing
  Koopman-based MPC control schemes for VTOL-DIP method and introducing a method
  for controlling VTOL-TIP in simulation.
  This method will become the backbone of my Koopman-based MPC
  control research effort.\
  \item DLO-02 (\textcolor{red}{TBD}):
  This method will extend PIKO-01 to a control method for the DLO-01 dataset.
