\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Look into transfer learning. Read \cite{tobin2017domain}.
	\item Look into domain randomization and adaptation.
	\item Reconstruct a pose estimation model to familiarize myself and then start modifying it.
	\item Read \cite{choi2013rgb}.
\end{itemize}


\section{Progress}
Following items are listed in order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pose Estimation: I began dissecting \cite{tobin2017domain}, they used a Bayesian model to estimate distance traveled between each frame. They also introduced a "smart feature-encoding disentanglement technique" which I need to understand. They also used Lie Algebra (some vector-domain representation) for 3D orientation. I will finish this paper for next week. I also went over PoseCNN code but I need to finish setting up computer and upgrade lab computer to U20.04 and start playing with their NN model and apply all some ideas.

	\item OCRTOC: I successfully upgraded my computer,
	      now moving to Ubuntu 20.04. I am trying to keep with Jerry at the same time trying to contribute on the research side.

	\item TensorFlow \cite{CVTF2}: I continued to
	      chapter 2, Dense layer turns out to be very basic implementation, a fully connected layer.

	\item MoreFusion \cite{MoreFusion}: Still need to write a literature review on this.

	\item Project Alpe with Nolan: We skipped this week's work session, we were both busy and Nolan had an important deadline.
	\item Reading list: \cite{lampinen2001bayesian} and \cite{li2019survey}.
	\item Quaternions:
	\item UR5e:
	\item Fellowship:




\end{itemize}

\section{Plans}
Following items are listed in order of priority:

\begin{itemize}

	\item (On pause) Continue with ROS Industrial tutorials and documentation.

	\item (On pause) Resume Robotic Perception course as soon as possible.

	\item (On pause) Read Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez and Woods.

\end{itemize}
