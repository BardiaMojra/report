\section{Progress}
Following items are listed in order of priority: 
\begin{itemize}  

  	\item Fellowship: I still need to work on my applications, I will write a new draft by next week. I have been avoiding this for far too long. 
  	
  	\item Machine Learning: I did not work on ML course this week. 
  	
  	\item ARIAC: I setup and ran the 2019 competition environment. I looked into Docker and Singularity containers and discussed them with Joe. It seems more reasonable to use Docker since it is already used by the competition organizers and Joe has experience working with it. 
    
    \item Gazebo: I need to do the tutorial on ROS integration.
    
  	\item ROS: I started the tutorial on ROS packages and build scripts. I also started a ROS mini course on Udemy, \cite{LearningROS}.
  
  	\item (On pause) Nolan and I have continued to work on TISR paper, I started a new document where I summarize background information. A copy of this document has been uploaded to GitHub.
 
  	\item (On pause) I still need to dissect \cite{PanopticSeg2019}, \cite{SVO}, \cite{HornsMethod}, \cite{NYUV2}, \cite{DGCNNLPC}, and \cite{MaskRCNN}.
  	
  	\item (On pause) I still need to dissect \cite{ZinsserWilliamKnowlton2006Oww}. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Plans}
Following items are listed in order of priority: 

\begin{itemize} 

	  \item Go through ROS Industrial tutorials and documentation. 
	
	  \item Go through UR Gazebo documentation. 

  	\item Resume Robotic Perception course as soon as possible.  
  
  	\item (On pause) Begin working on quaternions tutorial.  
 
  	\item (On pause) Need to read \cite{ImSRwDeepCNN}, \cite{MixDNNforSISR}, \cite{mModalSemanticSLAMwProb}, and \cite{RCANforImClass}; these papers seem fundamental to understanding the overall picture.

  	\item (On pause) Read Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez and Woods. 
 
 \end{itemize}
