\section{Progress}
Following items are listed in order of priority:
\begin{itemize}

	  \item OCRTOC: I managed to setup and run OCRTOC container on my laptop and test the competition environment. Chris and I will continue working on the simulation since it is due September 13th. We discussed

	  \item UR5: I set up the robotic arm at the center of the table as discussed but it is also simple to move to any side if needed. I put the electrical box behind the futon and that is where the hand controller is connected too. We probably need some ziptie to secure the cable to the table and the floor.

	  \item TensorFlow: Read first chapter of

	  \item Fellowship: I still need to work on my applications, I will write a new draft by next week. I have been avoiding this for far too long.

	  \item Machine Learning: I did not work on ML course this week.

  	  \item (On pause) Nolan and I have continued to work on TISR paper, I started a new document where I summarize background information. A copy of this document has been uploaded to GitHub.

  	  \item (On pause) I still need to dissect \cite{PanopticSeg2019}, \cite{SVO}, \cite{HornsMethod}, \cite{NYUV2}, \cite{DGCNNLPC}, and \cite{MaskRCNN}.

  	  \item (On pause) I still need to dissect \cite{ZinsserWilliamKnowlton2006Oww}.

\section{Plans}
Following items are listed in order of priority:

\begin{itemize}

	  \item Go through ROS Industrial tutorials and documentation.

	  \item Go through UR Gazebo documentation.

  	\item Resume Robotic Perception course as soon as possible.

  	\item (On pause) Begin working on quaternions tutorial.

  	\item (On pause) Need to read \cite{ImSRwDeepCNN}, \cite{MixDNNforSISR}, \cite{mModalSemanticSLAMwProb}, and \cite{RCANforImClass}; these papers seem fundamental to understanding the overall picture.

  	\item (On pause) Read Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez and Woods.

 \end{itemize}
