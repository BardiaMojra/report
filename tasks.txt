Tasks:
- Catch up on my reading list.
- Pose Estimation:
  - Read VEst \cite{dani2009position}.
  - Implement QuEst in Python.
  - OpenCV: Get comfortable using it.
  - Key point feature extraction.
  - Evaluate various pose estimation methods: PnP, QuEst, and else.
  - PVNet implementation: Paused. Working on a simple pose estimation for now.
  - Look into ARKit \cite{Augmente8:online}.
  - Look into ARCore \cite{Buildnew97:online}.
- NBV-Grasping:
  - Update URDF and Xacro files for UR5e to include sensor, sensor mount (with offset), and the gripper.
  - Add movement constrains for tables and scene.
  - Write two IK functions for gripper and sensor, one for each. It should plug-in with MoveIt configurator.
  - Research and implement point-cloud data to training TensorFlow models.
  - UR5e in simulation: Joe might consider.
  - Learn and implement GraspIt package.
- MSI Fellowship: On pause.
- Look into methods of generating uncertainty data.
