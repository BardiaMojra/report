\chapter*{Notes and Task List}
Notes: I need to create a more developed Gantt chart,
routinely brainstorm new ideas, and dedicate time to the progress of the
project. Below is a brief initial task list:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create Gantt chart
  \item Write paragraphs on separate ideas and edit later
      \item Real dataset:
      \begin{itemize}
            \item Design, discuss and build a data collection and test rig
            \item Define DLO classes and specs
            \item Purchase DLO samples for data collection
            \item Create data collection pipeline with capture, preprocessing,
            annotation, and storage modules.
            \item Develop a series of easy-to-perform standard dynamic tests
            for system identification of DLO's.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Unity dataset:
      \begin{itemize}
            \item Recreate virtual duplicates of physical test material
            \item Model dynamics and deformity
      \end{itemize}
      \item Develop "Optimal Real-Time Dynamic Model and Control" theory:
      \begin{itemize}
            \item Definition: Define what is to be optimized, over what domain,
            and with respect to what parameters and constraints. A robust
            ranking system or method is needed for almost all parameters.
            \item Define "Unit Segment" for deformable objects: define clearly
            with literature review.
            \item Estimated Parameters: estimated parameters of the object of
            interest which may \textit{slowly} change over time, permanently
            or temporarily' i.e. DLO stiffness due to repetitive bending or
            ambient temperature.
            \item Estimated Features: These are estimated constant features of
            the objects that do not change over time i.e. estimated length of a
            relatively short DLO in an environment with stable ambient
            temperature.
            \item Fundamental Features: These are the known characteristic
            parameters of a DLO that in some cases would be given to the system.
            These fundamental factors will not
            change over time, i.e. length of the DLO, cross-section thickness,
            and other known constant physical and dynamic characteristic
            features. If one fundamental parameter of an object changes (with
            specifics to be defined), we will treat it as a new object.
            \item Limiting Factors: These would be imposed or assumed constraints
            that limit the control state solution space i.e. unstable and
            impossible configurations, self-occlusion, and controller real-time
            compute time and real-time performance metric (for real-time and
            online self-evaluation).
            \item Other constraints such as external forces, lighting, DLO
            variations.
            \item Online Control Performance Self-Evaluation: This is needed for
            accurate evaluation and optimization of control performance in
            real-time.
      \end{itemize}
  \item Problem setup and reformulation: closed-loop geometric control
      system for real-time and stable feedback of the physical system.
  \item Optimization of dynamic system model for the most accurate
      real-time state estimation, control, and object manipulation.
  \item DLO parameter initialization on first sight: The nonlinear
      nature of DNN's could be exploited to train an adaptive model that
      predicts object parameters from a single image. Such quick estimation
      of the system's characteristic parameters (i.e. unknown spring and
      damping constants) could enable quick and precise control of DLO's.
      Moreover, these parameters will be tuned online using
      adaptive learning and control.
\end{itemize}
