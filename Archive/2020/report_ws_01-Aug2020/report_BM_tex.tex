\section{Progress}
Following items are listed in order of priority: 
\begin{itemize}  

  	\item Fellowship: I still need to work on my applications, I will write a new draft by next week. I have been avoiding this for far too long. 
  	
  	\item Machine Learning: I did not work on ML course this week. I looked into using python toolchain books. I know what books I need, I considered buying the books but it will be expensive and we already have some of them at the lab.  I think I would need a tablet instead, most of the books and Jupyter Notebooks are available online. 
  	
  	\item ARIAC: I did the tutorial for Gazebo Plugins and continued to setup ARIAC environment and realized it is best if we use a container such as Docker. Without it, it would be very difficult to setup Agile software development for multiple users on different machines. The reason
      
  	\item ROS: I continued with few tutorials on intermediate level. 
  
  	\item (On pause) Nolan and I have continued to work on TISR paper, I started a new document where I summarize background information. A copy of this document has been uploaded to GitHub 
 
  	\item (On pause) I still need to dissect \cite{PanopticSeg2019}, \cite{SVO}, \cite{HornsMethod}, \cite{NYUV2}, \cite{DGCNNLPC}, and \cite{MaskRCNN}.
  	
  	\item (On pause) I still need to dissect \cite{ZinsserWilliamKnowlton2006Oww}.

\section{Plans}
Following items are listed in order of priority: 

\begin{itemize} 

	\item Go through ROS Industrial tutorials and documentation. 
	
	\item Go through UR Gazebo documentation. 

  	\item Resume Robotic Perception course as soon as possible.  
  
  	\item (On pause) Begin working on quaternions tutorial.  
 
  	\item (On pause) Need to read \cite{ImSRwDeepCNN}, \cite{MixDNNforSISR}, \cite{mModalSemanticSLAMwProb}, and \cite{RCANforImClass}; these papers seem fundamental to understanding the overall picture.

  	\item (On pause) Read Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez and Woods. 
 
 \end{itemize}
