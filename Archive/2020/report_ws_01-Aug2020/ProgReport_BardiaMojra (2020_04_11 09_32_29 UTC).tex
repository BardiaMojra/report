\section{Progress}
Following items are listed in order of priority: 
\begin{itemize}  
	
  \item I ended up trying to set up BenchBot, \cite{Robovis20} , which is the evaluation environment used in Robotic Vision Scene Understanding challenge. BenchBot is more realistic and has better quality data in comparison to Gibson v2. I ran the installation script and I keep having an issue where I cannot finish the installation. It is possible that one of required libraries is not installed or configured properly. I will have to reach out to the team and ask someone to take a look it. There are two of these Ubuntu setup cases that I have got stuck on. The other issue occurs when I try to build ORB-SLAM2, \cite{orbSLAM2} , where it doesn't detect installed OpenCV module although it is a recommended version.
  
  \item Regarding SLAM tutorial, I finished Part A but I need to get the TurtleBot running. I found a good tutorial on TurtleBot's website. I will follow that tutorial for the basics, it seems to cover ROS as well. 
  
  \item I read \cite{PointNet} and \cite{AirSim}, both were interesting papers. I am interested in AirSim, specially since they have developed ground agents for the simulation environment. 
  
  \item Continue reading on RL, DRL and SLAM. I began reading on Turtlebot3 and ROS.
  
  \item Read , began to dissect it. It's a heavy paper, I have already read it twice, I need to go back and read it again and learn the material. 
    
  %\item Working on Bridge Fellowship?
    
  \item Still working on \cite{PanopticSeg2019}, \cite{SVO}, \cite{HornsMethod}, \cite{NYUV2}, \cite{DGCNNLPC}, and \cite{MaskRCNN}.

\end{itemize}

\section{Plans}
Following items are listed in order of priority: 

\begin{itemize} 
	
 \item (On pause) Resume Machine Learning course with Andrew Ng as soon as possible.  
 
 \item (On pause) I am working through Jason Brownlee's ML Mastery book, \cite{MLmasteryPy}.
 
 \item (On pause) Resume Robotic Perception course as soon as possible.

 \item (On pause) Need to read \cite{ImSRwDeepCNN}, \cite{MixDNNforSISR}, \cite{mModalSemanticSLAMwProb}, and \cite{RCANforImClass}; these papers seem fundamental to understanding the overall picture.

 \item (On pause) Get intimate with Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, and Matplotlib, TensorFlow and PyTorch. 

 \item (On pause) Read Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez and Woods. 

 \item (On pause) Learn ROS.
 
 \item (On pause) (Supremely important) Read on scene understanding, semantic SLAM, graph SLAM, visual odometer, place recognition, and Kalman Filtering. Read Niko Sunderhauf's research publications. 
 
 \end{itemize}


\section{General Notes}
This section summarizes general research leads. The following item are to be investigated, understood and briefly summarized. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Open3D: An open source toolbox used for truth occupancy grid application and probably other things. Should review. 
	
	\item Horn's paper \cite{HornsMethod}: It introduces Unit Quaternions which allow for complex domain representation of kinematics. Very important paper for robotic motion. Should review.
	
	\item Bayesian Learning: This probabilistic ML approach treats model parameters as random variables. Read \cite{Bayesian_Learning_2012} for more details. 
	
	\item Convex Optimization:
	
	\item Q-Learning: A learning model of reinforcement (RL), learning from delayed reward. 
	
	\item Deep Reinforcement Learning: 
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Single Image Super-Resolution Using Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network - MSSR \cite{MSSRwCNN}}

  Paper proposes an architecture with two parallel path with different depths (which correspond to scales) for residual learning; where one path (module L) is used for large factor up-scaling (x4, x8) and the other (module S) for small factor up-scaling (x2). At the end, it combines the outputs by summation (a form of ensembles). In contrast to previous work where the focus is on small factor up-scaling (x2) and repeat if needed, this model takes higher factor up-scaling into consideration while training the network which helps with reducing blurriness of output image for higher factor up-scaling. The model uses multi-scale residual learning to train on general model for multiple up-scaling factors; hence, saving memory and processing time. This paper provides experiment results that show higher output image integrity where peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) are higher or comparatively close to state-of-the-art methods.
