\section{Research Plan}
This section outlines my current research plan where the main ideas, target
conference/journal, and expected date of completion for each paper
are provided.
Target conferences: ICRA, IROS (March), CASE (Late Feb.), NIPS.

  and performance comparison with optimal, robust, and/or
  adaptive control schemes.\

  A review on Koopman-based control schemes. \textcolor{red}{Not enough, make
  it part of another paper.} Read papers and write literature reviews.\

  \item Koopman-03 (\textcolor{black}{RAL - Mar. 1st - status}):
  Extension to Koopman-01, Koopman-based dynamic estimation of DLO,
  collect dynamic DLO dataset,
  prediction of DLO configuration.

  compare performance, offline-online learing/adapting, fast transfer learning.
  \item Koopman-06 (\textcolor{black}{IROS/RAL - date - status}):
  PIKO-based unit segment model for DLOs, more generalized, should yield better
  performance if number segments are selected online in order to
  obtain optimal representation in real-time given available hardware, compare
  results.

\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item QEKF Paper (\textcolor{red}{On pause}):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Noise issue: noise cannot be modeled - DMD is a robust noise on high dimensional orthonormal time series and should be able to denoise QuEst solutions.
      \item SfM: RQuEst cannot find solution - A potential solution is described  briefly above.
  \end{itemize}
  \item  DLO Manipulation: (\textcolor{red}{ICRA - section out of date})
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Setup digital twin reinforcement learing setup:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Unity Robotics extension setup -- done.
        \item Design dynamic DLO data collection system.
        \item Build work cell. -- done
        \item Collect data and create a dataset.
        \item Define evaluation metrics.
        \item Create a high frequency RGBD dataset with UV-frames and open-loop input control actions as the ground truth.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Real-Time Preception -- on hold
      \item Learning DLO Dynamics and System Identification - PIKO - On-going
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DoD SMART (\textcolor{red}{Dec 1st.}): I started the application.\\
    \item DLO Manipulation (\textcolor{red}{IROS}):
    This week, Dr. Gans and I debugged MPC-Koopman Cart-Pendulum code and I was
    able to run some tests. For now, I ran 5 simple tests where they all have
    the same training configuration but the tests are run for different lengths.
    The goal of this preliminary experiment is to examine controller stability
    of at steady state. The original code used 10 sets, 200 samples each for
    training and 200 samples for test run duration. I kept the same training
    congfiguration and increased test run samples from 200 to a range from 500
    to 100,000 samples. Figure 1 depicts lifted state variables and control
    input for T000002 with 1000 test run samples. I observed a mild
    oscillation about the upright position but it is more stable at steady state
    than an optimal controller. This is very interesting. Compared
    to an optimal controller, MPC-Koopman controller damps state error much less
    aggressively but it is UUB stable for much longer. Figure 2 depicts the
    system lifted state and control input for T000004 with 20,000 test run
    sample. An optimal controller,
    exhibits random jerky response that makes the system eventually become
    unstable. I will review the results with Dr. Gans, work on DOD Smart proposal
    and move on to the dataset \cite{abraham2017model}.\\
