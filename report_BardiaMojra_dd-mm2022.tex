\section{Specific Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item DLO Manipulation Dataset (ICRA - \textcolor{red}{Sept. 19th}) - on-going.
  \item VPQEKF (\textcolor{red}{---}): On pause. Asif may look into it.
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item QEKF Paper (\textcolor{red}{On pause}):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Noise issue: noise cannot be modeled - DMD is a robust noise on high dimensional orthonormal time series and should be able to denoise QuEst solutions.
      \item SfM: RQuEst cannot find solution - A potential solution is described  briefly above.
  \end{itemize}
  \item  DLO Manipulation: (\textcolor{red}{ICRA - section out of date})
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Work on the paper everyday -- up-coming
      \item ICRA 2022 RL workshops: gym, stable-baseline3, and RL zoo -- on-going
      \item Setup digital twin reinforcement learing setup:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Unity Robotics extension setup -- on-going.
        \item Design dynamic DLO data collection system.
        \item Build work cell. -- on-going
        \item Collect data and create a dataset.
        \item Define evaluation metrics.
        \item Create a high frequency RGBD dataset with UV-frames and open-loop input control actions as the ground truth.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Real-Time Preception -- on hold
      \item Learning DLO Dynamics and System Identification
      \begin{itemize}
            \item List feasible approached for learing DLO dynamics -- done
            \item Model dynamics and deformity in a latent space
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DLO State Estimation (\textcolor{red}{IROS}):
    On piDMD \emph{\textbf{BCCB}}, it stands for
    \emph{block-continuous-continuous-block} and is a cubic configuration for
    performing 3D \emph{fast Fourier transform}. The presented implementtation
    does not run and its root cause was not investigated. The implementtation is
    equivalent to multiplying data matrix \(\mathbb{X}\) with the Kronecker
    product of two \emph{discrete Fourier transform matrices} (DFTMat) with dimension
    factors of M and N as input. M and N are the least factors for square
    matrices to become the size. This condition is necessary for DFTMat to be
    applied to a Tensor. I wonder if using a tensor might be necessary to
    correctly meet 3D adjacency constraints of the physical world.\
    \emph(UpperTriangular and diagonal) constraints enforce 2D adjacency
    but we are only able to run the diagonal. Triangular methods use RQ
    decomposition (yields a singular and full-rank matrix for model) and are
    thought to be computationally more efficient as
    authors claimed~\cite{baddoo2021physics}.\\
    I was able to run the algorithm with various \emph{circulant} constraints
    which, resulted in poor performance but its surface plot clearly shows a
    frequency reconstruction in polar coordinated frame. The implementtation
    calls \(fft2()\) routine which, performs \emph{discrete Fourier transform}
    on a matrix (2D). Understanding these details is essential for constructing
    a viable solution for real-time manipulation and control on DLOs.\\
    Furthermore, I continued testing and investigating piDMD and all it can
    possibly offer. I plotted reconstructions and model
    \emph{performance surfaces} and made a startling realization that piDMD is
    only performing system identification task and as implemented, resultant
    reconstructions cannot possibly be very accurate. This is related to
    highly chaotic nature of DLOs; no matter how accurate and precise the model
    is, it will go out of \emph{synch}. Chaotic systems are still nonlinear
    systems and they need to be treated \emph{locally in time}. What we are
    aiming to achieve is to \emph{model (or linearize)} a
    DLO \emph{globally in space}. Thus, there needs to be online observations.\\
    I went back to Murphy's paper to implement a Koopman-based controller
    where, they use data collected from a
    vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) pendulum system \cite{abraham2017model}.
    In the paper, they mentioned data collected is a combination of multiple
    test runs with different initial conditions. The purpose of this is to
    obtain a set of Koopman operators or model that is robust to a range of
    initial conditions. Moreover, they use Koopman operator only for system
    identification and utilize optimal control with a L2 regularizer.\
    Currently, I am working on Koopman operator approximator routine that
    takes in number of lifting dimensions and choice of basis functions.
    On a side note, we never lifted the space in the current implementation of
    DLO code with piDMD but we can as the feature exists.\\
    \item Maicol (REU): I want him to continue developing high quality model of
    workcell (not the lab) and implement basic manipulation tasks. I need this
    for DLO project and I can not do everything on my own. I can learn anything
    so I aim high enough that I can barely make it. You do not support that
    eventhough you have been patient with me.
    In my strategy, I work on
    cutting edge problems that others can not and I start with what is of most
    strategic importance to me, i.e. learning controls and classical computer
    vision while I am still a PhD student.\\
    I am sacrificing more than anybody else to achieve my goals and
    increasingly I feel isolated because of your comments. Comments that show
    no interest or respect for my work and seem be betting against me everytime.
    I came here to do good research and no one has any interest in that.\\
    \item DoD SMART (\textcolor{red}{Dec 1st.}): I started the application.\\
    \item XEst (\textcolor{red}{RAL ---}): No update.\\
