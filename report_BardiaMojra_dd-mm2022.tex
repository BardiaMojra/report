\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item QEKF Paper (\textcolor{red}{On pause}):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Noise issue: noise cannot be modeled - DMD is a robust noise on high dimensional orthonormal time series and should be able to denoise QuEst solutions.
      \item SfM: RQuEst cannot find solution - A potential solution is described  briefly above.
  \end{itemize}
  \item  DLO Manipulation: (\textcolor{red}{ICRA - section out of date})
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Setup digital twin reinforcement learing setup:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Unity Robotics extension setup -- done.
        \item Design dynamic DLO data collection system.
        \item Build work cell. -- done
        \item Collect data and create a dataset.
        \item Define evaluation metrics.
        \item Create a high frequency RGBD dataset with UV-frames and open-loop input control actions as the ground truth.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Real-Time Preception -- on hold
      \item Learning DLO Dynamics and System Identification - PIKO - On-going

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DLO Manipulation (\textcolor{red}{IROS}):
    Last week, I was finally able to understand how Koopman operator is
    implemented. I was able to find the implementation by Ian Abraham for
    their DLO paper \cite{abraham2017model}. I ported the code in from Python
    to Matlab and successfully run the project with a Van Der Pol model. As they
    explain, a Van Der Pol model is created for generating multiple runs with
    known random initial conditions and control input. Total of 10 runs with
    200 time samples each are collected and concatenated. Multiple runs with
    random initial conditions is crucial for properly capturing dominant dynamics
    of the entire system. Moreover, the 2 dimensional system was lifted to 4
    and a unique choice of basis function was used. The implementation is
    fully object oriented which, allows quick and easy reuse with any simulation
    or choice of basis function. Now, we want to replace Van Der Pol oscillator
    with a double-pendulum, experiment with different choices of basis function,
    and model predictive control (MPC) control schemes.
    Later in the week, I learned Matlab Simscape multi-body simulator and
    created a double-pendulum model.
    At this time, I am learning about Simscape models and objects and how they
    could be integrated into Matlab source code. This is a huge feat because
    the model can be extended without having to change the source code and
    Matlab code generator can be used to generate C, C++, and CUDA source code.
    This is where object oriented implementation makes all the difference and
    due to my implementation, the integration will require minimal effort.\\
    \item Maicol (REU): No update, he is busy with classes.\\
    \item DoD SMART (\textcolor{red}{Dec 1st.}): I started the application.\\
    \item XEst (\textcolor{red}{RAL ---}): No update.\\
  \end{itemize}
