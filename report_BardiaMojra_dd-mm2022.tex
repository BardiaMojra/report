\section{Specific Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
      \item VPQEKF (\textcolor{red}{---}): Work on the paper.
      \item DLO Manipulation Dataset (ICRA - \textcolor{red}{Sept. 1st})
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item QEKF Paper - 30\% extension (\textcolor{red}{---}):
  \item Implementation (\textcolor{red}{---}):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Noise issue: noise cannot be modeled - revisit
      \item Rewrite RQuEst (RANSAC-QuEst) -- Done
      \item Replace the relative pose estimation routine in SfM example with RQuEst -- Done
      \item SfM: RQuEst cannot find solution -- under investigation
  \end{itemize}
  \item  DLO Manipulation: (\textcolor{red}{ICRA - Sept. 1st})
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Work on the paper everyday -- up-coming
      \item ICRA 2022 RL workshops: gym, stable-baseline3, and RL zoo -- on-going
      \item Setup digital twin reinforcement learing setup:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Unity Robotics extension setup -- on-going.
        \item Design dynamic DLO data collection system.
        \item Build work cell. -- on-going
        \item Collect data and create a dataset.
        \item Define evaluation metrics.
        \item Create a high frequency RGBD dataset with UV-frames and open-loop input control actions as the ground truth.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Real-Time Preception
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Deep learning methods for keypoint pose estimation in real-time.
        \item Use UV dye dataset
        \item Use PVNet-like approach for known-object pose estimation.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Learning DLO Dynamics and System Identification
      \begin{itemize}
            \item List feasible approached for learing DLO dynamics
            \item Model dynamics and deformity in a latent space
      \end{itemize}
      \item Real-Time Control
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Time model inference, using auto-encoders generate the lowest
        dimensional representation for each object.
        \item Use another GAN model for object deformity for each object.
        \item Evaluate encoded representation for accuracy.
        \item Used another GAN to explore other abstraced representations from
        individual encoded representation. In theory, we can create a low
        dimensionsal representation for multiple similar objects, given all
        individual low-dimensional representations. This is inspired by "fundamental
        principles first" approach which has universal applicability.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
    \item XEst (\textcolor{red}{RAL ---}): I integrated Kaveh's QuEst algorithm
    into Matlab's Structure from Motion (SfM) example. The example is based on
    \cite{nister2004efficient} and \cite{torr2000mlesac}; I have replaced Nister's
    5-point algorithm with Kaveh's QuEst. I will Implement a new RANSAC method
    once I figure out why SfM-QuEst doesn't produce feasible results.
    It runs but current RANSAC \cite{torr2000mlesac} can
    not find a feasible solution in given number of trials. This can be due to
    noise on Quaternion solutions or possibly an implementation bug. I am
    currently investigating this by comparing results with existing
    Implementation.
    The new RANSAC methods with use Quaternion specific evaluation metrics as
    well as Sampson distance. The new approach will feature constraint
    satisfaction problem implementation by either using priorities, weights, or
    an algorithmic approach handle multiple static constraints. The new RANSAC
    will be a solid contribution on its own. This project might take a bit
    longer but at this point, I am aiming for setting new SOTA and getting
    top paper award.

    \item DLO Dataset (\textcolor{red}{ICRA - Sept. 1st}): I am starting on the paper this week. I begin with paper
    structure and related work and start with that everyday moving forward. Moreover,
    I am working on Unity-Robotics extension. Moreover, I am implementing
    \cite{zhang2021robots} on my work station. We picked up the parts for MoCap
    system but there were no fastening parts with the shipment. Please advise
    on that. I am spending more time on this as I am worried about the progress
    too.

    \item Linus (REU): He is working on ROS2 tutorials. I have asked him to
    upload what he has on Unity to Github so I can finish the workcell.
    \item Maicol (REU): He is working on Unity tutorials. Soon, he will start
    on Unity-Robotics extention. Turtlebot tutorials are given lower priority.

    \item PyTorch Tutorials: Transfer learning.
    \item Omniverse: Apply for access. -- To-Do

  \end{itemize}
