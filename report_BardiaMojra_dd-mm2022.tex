\section{Specific Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
      \item VPQEKF (\textcolor{red}{---}): On pause. Asif may look into it.
      \item DLO Manipulation Dataset (ICRA - \textcolor{red}{Sept. 1st}) - on-going.
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item QEKF Paper - 30\% extension (\textcolor{red}{---}):
  \item Implementation (\textcolor{red}{---}):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Noise issue: noise cannot be modeled - revisit
      \item SfM: RQuEst cannot find solution -- under investigation - HAVOK?
  \end{itemize}
  \item  DLO Manipulation: (\textcolor{red}{ICRA - Sept. 1st})
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Work on the paper everyday -- up-coming
      \item ICRA 2022 RL workshops: gym, stable-baseline3, and RL zoo -- on-going
      \item Setup digital twin reinforcement learing setup:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Unity Robotics extension setup -- on-going.
        \item Design dynamic DLO data collection system.
        \item Build work cell. -- on-going
        \item Collect data and create a dataset.
        \item Define evaluation metrics.
        \item Create a high frequency RGBD dataset with UV-frames and open-loop input control actions as the ground truth.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Real-Time Preception -- on hold
      \item Learning DLO Dynamics and System Identification
      \begin{itemize}
            \item List feasible approached for learing DLO dynamics -- done
            \item Model dynamics and deformity in a latent space
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
    \item XEst (\textcolor{red}{RAL ---}): No update.


    \item DLO State Estimation (\textcolor{red}{ICRA - Sept. 15th}): Last week,
    I was mostly busy with Unity tutorials and dealing with the financial aid
    office. I had to figure out why they thought I make too much money to qualify
    for FAFSA.
    This week,
    I will work on the DLO environment \cite{yu2022shape} in Unity to extract
    state and input data.

    \item Maicol (REU): I have asked Maicol to wrap up his work on work-cell
    digital twin in Unity and prepare a short presentation. I asked him present
    his work to the lab as soon as possible and focus on his classes. He is
    taking Electronics, Embedded I, Operating Systems and another class. He is
    interested in helping with DLO project as well as his own DT project.
    I told him that I dont want him to slow me down but if anything comes up,
    I will discuss it with him.
    \item DoD SMART (\textcolor{red}{Dec 1st.}): I started the application.

    \item PyTorch Tutorials: Transfer learning.

  \end{itemize}
