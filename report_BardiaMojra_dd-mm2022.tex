\section{Specific Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item DLO Manipulation Dataset (ICRA - \textcolor{red}{Sept. 19th}) - on-going.
  \item VPQEKF (\textcolor{red}{---}): On pause. Asif may look into it.
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item QEKF Paper (\textcolor{red}{On pause}):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Noise issue: noise cannot be modeled - DMD is a robust noise on high dimensional orthonormal time series and should be able to denoise QuEst solutions.
      \item SfM: RQuEst cannot find solution - A potential solution is described  briefly above.
  \end{itemize}
  \item  DLO Manipulation: (\textcolor{red}{ICRA - section out of date})
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Work on the paper everyday -- up-coming
      \item ICRA 2022 RL workshops: gym, stable-baseline3, and RL zoo -- on-going
      \item Setup digital twin reinforcement learing setup:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Unity Robotics extension setup -- on-going.
        \item Design dynamic DLO data collection system.
        \item Build work cell. -- on-going
        \item Collect data and create a dataset.
        \item Define evaluation metrics.
        \item Create a high frequency RGBD dataset with UV-frames and open-loop input control actions as the ground truth.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Real-Time Preception -- on hold
      \item Learning DLO Dynamics and System Identification
      \begin{itemize}
            \item List feasible approached for learing DLO dynamics -- done
            \item Model dynamics and deformity in a latent space
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}


    \item DLO State Estimation (\textcolor{red}{ICRA - Sept. 15th}): I am working
    piDMD source code and trying to understand how I can use the \emph{\textbf{BCCB}}
    configuration \cite{baddoo2021physics}. The provided examples are minimal
    and there are no instructions on how to use or even what it stands for.
    But fortunately I think I understand the underlying mathematics.\\
    They acknowledge some of their solutions are unstable and provide an
    \emph{alternative solution to the upper-triangular piDMD problem.} They use
    \emph{economy RQ decomposition of X} to write (84) and since \emph{the first
    two terms of (84) are independent of \textbf{A} and, by multiplicity of the
    Forbenius norm, have a non-negative sum.} On this basis, the
    upper-triangular Procrustes is phrased (85) and borrowing a multi-row-wise
    optimization computational technique from \emph{Block Discrete Fourier
    Transform,} they write (88) as a direct solution for \textbf{A}, given
    provided \emph{\textbf{data is rank deficient}}. Most often in real-world
    experiments, data collected is rack deficient due to noise and measurement
    imperfections. Moreover, they provide (89) as means to compute \textbf{R}
    recursively backwards in order incease computational efficacy.

    \item Maicol (REU): He did well. DT is the future the industry has been dreaming of.
    \item DoD SMART (\textcolor{red}{Dec 1st.}): I started the application.
    \item XEst (\textcolor{red}{RAL ---}): No update.

    \item PyTorch Tutorials: Transfer learning.

  \end{itemize}
