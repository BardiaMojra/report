  \item Koopman-06 (\textcolor{black}{IROS/RAL - date - status}):
  PIKO-based unit segment model for DLOs, more generalized, should yield better

\section{To Do - Out of date}
\begin{itemize}
  \item QEKF Paper (\textcolor{red}{On pause}):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Noise issue: noise cannot be modeled - DMD is a robust noise on high dimensional orthonormal time series and should be able to denoise QuEst solutions.
      \item SfM: RQuEst cannot find solution - A potential solution is described  briefly above.
  \end{itemize}
  \item  DLO Manipulation: (\textcolor{red}{ICRA - section out of date})
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Setup digital twin reinforcement learing setup:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Unity Robotics extension setup -- done.
        \item Design dynamic DLO data collection system.
        \item Build work cell. -- done
        \item Collect data and create a dataset.
        \item Define evaluation metrics.
        \item Create a high frequency RGBD dataset with UV-frames and open-loop input control actions as the ground truth.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Real-Time Preception -- on hold
      \item Learning DLO Dynamics and System Identification - PIKO - On-going

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DoD SMART (\textcolor{red}{Dec 1st.}): I will be working on this for
    the next couple weeks.\\
    \item DLO Dataset (\textcolor{red}{Dec 1st.}): I am currently designing the
    test. Later this week, I need to figure out how I want to collect visual and
    pose data for the DLO. I think the best method would be a combination of
    multiple cameras and depth sensors. I will discuss this with Dr. Gans and
    Chris to get their input. For the test, so far I have the following:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Clamped end low, DLO on table and flat, change gripper pose, no
      twist on DLO: omega shape, s shape, u shape, circle shape, ellipse shape,
      spiral.\
      \item Clamped end low, DLO on table and 3D, with twist: same shapes.
      \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 30 degrees and 3D, without twist: same shapes.
      \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 45 degrees and 3D, without twist: same shapes.
      \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 60 degrees and 3D, without twist: same shapes.
      \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 30 degrees and 3D, with twist: same shapes.
      \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 45 degrees and 3D, with twist: same shapes.
      \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 60 degrees and 3D, with twist: same shapes.
    \end{itemize}

    \item DLO Manipulation (\textcolor{red}{IROS}):
    Dr. Gans and I reviewed the Koopman cart-pendulum controller and there seem
    to be a bug in the code, \cite{abraham2017model}. The solution does not
    converge to zero as it should. I suspect the issue is related to Matlab and
    Python handle vectors differently. I will inject known vector into both
    implementation and trace where computational divergence begins. I am putting
    this on pause until after the dataset is collected or some progress has been
    made on that effort.\\
    \item Maicol (REU): I gave him my paper on optimal control of double
    inverted pendulum to read, it is gentle introduction to advanced robotics.
    There, I show modeling and derivation of optimal controller for a nonlinear
    and chaotic system. \\
    \item XEst (\textcolor{red}{RAL ---}): No update.\\
  \end{itemize}
