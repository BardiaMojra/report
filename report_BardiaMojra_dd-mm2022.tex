\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
  \item DoD SMART (\textcolor{red}{Dec 1st.}): I am currently working on this.\\
  \item DLO Dataset (\textcolor{red}{Dec 1st.}): I finished designing the test.
  This week, I will finish the test setup design and BOM. I will send out the
  BOM by the end of this week. Moreover, I am installing Unity, Fusion360, and
  setting up Intel Realsense for data collection. We will use a Realsense D455
  and I borroughed one from the lab.
  \item DLO Manipulation (\textcolor{red}{IROS}): \cite{abraham2017model}.\\
  \item Maicol (REU): He is working with me on DLO dataset. \\
  \item XEst (\textcolor{red}{RAL ---}): No update.\\
  \end{itemize}

\section{Research Plan - Out of date}
This section outlines my current research plan where the main ideas, target
conference/journal, and expected date of completion for each paper
are provided.
Target conferences: ICRA, IROS (March), CASE (Late Feb.), NIPS.
Target Journals: RAL, CVPR, CORAL.

  and performance comparison with optimal, robust, and/or
  adaptive control schemes.\
  \item Koopman-02 (\textcolor{red}{ACC - Sep 30th - active}):
  A review on Koopman-based control schemes. \textcolor{red}{Not enough, make
  it part of another paper.} Read papers and write literature reviews.\

  \item Koopman-03 (\textcolor{black}{RAL - Mar. 1st - status}):
  Extension to Koopman-01, Koopman-based dynamic estimation of DLO,
  collect dynamic DLO dataset,
  prediction of DLO configuration.
