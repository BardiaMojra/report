\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
      \item VPQEKF (April 1st, 2022): I am almost done debugging and rewriting
      the \cite{quest} source code; the issue at this point is the SVD function
      provided by Scipy as it has a
      different default configuration than what is implemented in Matlab. I
      tried a few different options as explained in the documentation but I was
      not able to resolve the issue. I messaged Dr. Gans tonight, he will
      probably respond over the weekend. In the meantime, I have debugged the
      code line by line, except at the very end. I even saved keypoints from Matlab
      in full precision and loaded them into Python implementation to check and
      confirm its computational integrity. This is needed since the RANSAC
      feature selects a different set of keypoints each time and we are solving
      large high order matrices where a small error could propagate into the
      computation. Moreover, in my
      implementation, first I find the most prominent keypoints and select the
      top 30. I perform the same on the next image frame and then I proceed to
      match the keypoints and find the top five correspondences with the
      highest cross-matched scores. Once this paper is submitted, I can quickly
      write additional papers by deploying different variations of the EKF
      filter, e.g. Unscented-EKF, Ensemble-EKF. Dr. Gans could provide more
      expert insight at a later time.
      \item DLO Manipulation: No update.
      \item Pose Estimation: I will need it for DLO segment localization.
      \item NBV-Grasping Project: No update.
      \item PyTorch Tutorials: Transfer learning.
\end{itemize}

\section{Intermediate Goals - Fall 2021:}
\begin{itemize}
      \item QEKF: Finish paper.
      \item UR5e: Do the tutorials.
\end{itemize}
