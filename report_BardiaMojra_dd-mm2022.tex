\section{DLO Dataset Tests}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Clamped end low, DLO on table and flat, change gripper pose, no
  twist on DLO:\@ omega shape, s shape, u shape, circle shape, ellipse shape,
  spiral.
  \item Clamped end low, DLO on table and 3D, with twist: same shapes.
  \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 30 degrees and 3D, without twist.
  \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 45 degrees and 3D, without twist.
  \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 60 degrees and 3D, without twist.
  \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 75 degrees and 3D, without twist.
  \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 90 degrees and 3D, without twist.
  \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 30 degrees and 3D, with twist.
  \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 45 degrees and 3D, with twist.
  \item Clamped end low, DLO angles at 60 degrees and 3D, with twist.

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
  \item DoD SMART (\textcolor{red}{Dec 1st.}): I have been working on this.
  The application is ready, I just need to finish the statement.\\
  \item DLO Dataset (\textcolor{red}{Dec 1st.}): The DLO mount has been designed
  and should be printed by now. I will make a spreadsheet for the part needed.
  \item DLO Manipulation (\textcolor{red}{IROS}): \cite{abraham2017model}.\\
  \item Maicol (REU): He is working with me on DLO dataset. \\
  \item XEst (\textcolor{red}{RAL ---}): No update.\\
  \end{itemize}

\section{Research Plan - Out of date}
This section outlines my current research plan where the main ideas, target
conference/journal, and expected date of completion for each paper
are provided.
Target conferences: ICRA, IROS (March), CASE (Late Feb.), NIPS.
Target Journals: RAL, CVPR, CORAL.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Koopman-01 (\textcolor{red}{IROS - Dec. 1st - active}):
  Koopman-based MPC control of VTOL-DIP and VTOL-TIP in simulation,
  DLO pose estimation in simulation,
  experiments on choice of basis function and lifting dimensions,
  and performance comparison with optimal, robust, and/or
  adaptive control schemes.\
  \item Koopman-02 (\textcolor{red}{ACC - Sep 30th - active}):
  A review on Koopman-based control schemes. \textcolor{red}{Not enough, make
  it part of another paper.} Read papers and write literature reviews.\

  \item Koopman-03 (\textcolor{black}{RAL - Mar. 1st - status}):
  Extension to Koopman-01, Koopman-based dynamic estimation of DLO,
  collect dynamic DLO dataset,
  prediction of DLO configuration.

  \item Quest-01 (\textcolor{orange}{IROS - Mar. 1st - next}):
  Optimal transform solution for QuEst based on dominant mode decomposition (DMD).

\end{itemize}
