\section{Specific Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
      \item VPQEKF: Combine QuEst and Vest with QEKF paper.
      \item NBV-Grasping.
      \item Universal pose estimation or a novel and superior approach.
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Catch up on my reading list.
  \item PVQEKF:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Update state definition and measurement matrices. -- Done.
      \item Get ROS environment up and running. -- Next: test header include bug theory.
  \end{itemize}
  \item NBV-Grasping:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Update URDF and Xacro files for UR5e to include sensor, sensor mount (with offset), and the gripper. -- Next
      \item Add movement constraints for tables and scenes.
      \item Write two IK functions for gripper and sensor, one for each. It should plug-in with MoveIt configurator.
      \item Research and implement point-cloud data to training TensorFlow models.
      \item Learn and implement GraspIt package.
      \end{itemize}
  \item MSI Fellowship: On pause.
\end{itemize}

\section{Reading List}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Vision-based robotic grasping from object localization, object pose estimation to grasp estimation for parallel grippers - a review \cite{du2020vision} - On-going.
      \item Leveraging feature uncertainty in the pnp problem \cite{ferraz2014leveraging}.
      \item Normalized objects \cite{Wang_2019_CVPR}.
      \item Berk Calli's YCB \cite{calli2015ycb}.
      \item NASA papers \cite{NASATech44:online}.
      \item Roadmap \cite{roadmap251:online}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
      \item VPQEKF: I finished updating state transition model and observation model
      matrices. I am currently debugging data handling and computation.

      EKF is a low dimensional joint probability distribution robust estimator. It essentially combines dynamically constrained robust estimator with i.i.d. random variable noise assumption to create a more accurate model the real world, a chaotic system. It makes \textit{full state estimations} with tuned noise variance tolerances that allows for random noise conspensation. An observation is made and EKF update it's \textit{belief} according to both \textit{prior belief} and \textit{current observation}. In a low dimensional context, the weights assigning proportionality to \textit{prior belief} and \textit{current observation} for every state (dimension) are called \textbf{the Kalman
      gain}.


      EKF's update step computes \textit{the residual} -- finished section at a later time.

      \item NBV Grasping Project: No update.
      \item NASA MSI Fellowship: Need to read more NASA papers. -- On pause.
      \item PyTorch Tutorials: Transfer learning.
      \item Pose Estimation: On pause.
      \item SD Team: No update.
      \item EE Autonobots: No update.
\end{itemize}

\section{Immediate Plans - Summer 2021:}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:

\begin{itemize}
      \item UTARI: Dr. Gans' pose and velocity estimation paper.
      \item NBV-Grasping:
      \item Pose estimation: Survey paper.
\end{itemize}

\section{Intermediate Goals - Fall 2021:}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Pose estimation: I must be finished with implementation, perhaps make some improvements, and should be working on a paper for ICRA or CVPR.
      \item Scene understanding and active learning: After pose estimation, I want to expand my research into scene understanding and active learning in the context of advanced manufacturing.
      \item ARIAC: Once I am up to speed, I will do the ARIAC workshops/tutorials and will talk to Jerry about possible contributions.
\end{itemize}
