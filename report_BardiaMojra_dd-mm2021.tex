\section{Specific Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
      \item VPQEKF: Combine QuEst and Vest with QEKF paper.
      \item NBV-Grasping.
      \item Universal pose estimation.
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Catch up on my reading list.
  \item PVQEKF:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Update state definition and measurement matrices. -- On going.
      \item Get ROS environment up and running. -- Next: test header include bug theory.
  \end{itemize}
  \item NBV-Grasping:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Update URDF and Xacro files for UR5e to include sensor, sensor mount (with offset), and the gripper.
      \item Add movement constraints for tables and scenes.
      \item Write two IK functions for gripper and sensor, one for each. It should plug-in with MoveIt configurator.
      \item Research and implement point-cloud data to training TensorFlow models.
      \item Learn and implement GraspIt package.
      \end{itemize}
  \item MSI Fellowship: On pause.
\end{itemize}

\section{Reading List}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Vision-based robotic grasping from object localization, object pose estimation to grasp estimation for parallel grippers - a review \cite{du2020vision} - On-going.
      \item Leveraging feature uncertainty in the pnp problem \cite{ferraz2014leveraging}.
      \item Normalized objects \cite{Wang_2019_CVPR}.
      \item Berk Calli's YCB \cite{calli2015ycb}.
      \item NASA papers \cite{NASATech44:online}.
      \item Roadmap \cite{roadmap251:online}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
      \item VPQEKF: I had a meeting with Dr. Gans and Asif, we went over State Transform and Observation matrices and updated them according to QuEst and Vest as input data. I went over Kalman filter and Extended Kalman Filter in detail and took some notes. I am working on updating QEKF matrices.

      \item NBV Grasping Project: I spent couple hours this week and went over what I have done so far, which is basic setup. I have the \textit{URDF.XACRO} file where it holds default values and macros for \textit{UR5e}. Next, I need to update it by adding the mount and the table.

      \item NASA MSI Fellowship: Need to read more NASA papers. -- On pause.
      \item PyTorch Tutorials: Transfer learning.
      \item PE Survey (On pause): I think it might be that it is not worth the time to work on a pose estimation survey paper at this point. It is too much work for a journal paper. I have gained enough knowledge and skill to implement some new idea in regards to pose estimation. I can work on this after VPQEKF paper or even after NBV-Grasping.

      \item SD Team: No update.
      \item EE Autonobots: No update.
\end{itemize}

\section{Immediate Plans - Summer 2021:}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:

\begin{itemize}
      \item UTARI: Dr. Gans' pose and velocity estimation paper.
      \item NBV-Grasping:
      \item Pose estimation: Survey paper.
\end{itemize}

\section{Intermediate Goals - Fall 2021:}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Pose estimation: I must be finished with implementation, perhaps make some improvements, and should be working on a paper for ICRA or CVPR.
      \item Scene understanding and active learning: After pose estimation, I want to expand my research into scene understanding and active learning in the context of advanced manufacturing.
      \item ARIAC: Once I am up to speed, I will do the ARIAC workshops/tutorials and will talk to Jerry about possible contributions.
\end{itemize}
