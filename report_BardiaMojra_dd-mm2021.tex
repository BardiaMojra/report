\section{Specific Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Pose Estimation: Implement and improve.
      \item NBV-Grasping.
      \item Pose estimation survey.
      \item Universal pose estimation.
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Catch up on my reading list.
  \item Pose Estimation:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Read \cite{ma2012invitation}, up to chapter 5. Finished chapeter 3.
      \item Key point feature extraction: ORB, SIFT, SURF.
      \item Read VEst \cite{dani2009position}. - Done
      \item Implement QuEst in Python.
      \item Survey: I need start working on this.
      \item Evaluate various pose estimation methods: PnP, QuEst, and else.
      \item PVNet implementation: Paused. Working on a simple pose estimation for now.
  \end{itemize}
  \item NBV-Grasping:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Update URDF and Xacro files for UR5e to include sensor,
sensor mount (with offset), and the gripper.
      \item Add movement constraints for tables and scenes.
      \item Write two IK functions for gripper and sensor, one for each. It should plug-in with MoveIt configurator.
      \item Research and implement point-cloud data to training TensorFlow models.
      \item UR5e in simulation: Joe might consider.
      \item Learn and implement GraspIt package.
      \end{itemize}

  \item MSI Fellowship: On pause.
  \item Look into methods of generating uncertainty data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Reading List}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Vision-based robotic grasping from object localization, object pose estimation to grasp estimation for parallel grippers - a review \cite{du2020vision} - On-going.
      \item NASA papers \cite{NASATech44:online}
      \item Leveraging feature uncertainty in the pnp problem \cite{ferraz2014leveraging}
      \item Berk Calli's YCB \cite{calli2015ycb}
      \item Normalized objects \cite{Wang_2019_CVPR}
      \item Roadmap \cite{roadmap251:online}
\end{itemize}

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Pose Estimation: On reading \cite{du2020vision}, I finished chapter 3 and will finish reading chapter 4 over the weekend. I plan on meeting Dr. Gans on Monday and discuss next step. He wants me to read QuEst and VEst papers again which will be helpful.

      \item QuEst \cite{QuEst}: Will read again.
      \item VEst \cite{dani2009position}: Will read again.
      \item NASA MSI Fellowship: Need to read more NASA papers.
      \item PyTorch Tutorials: Transfer learning.

      \item NBV Grasping Project: With Chris' help, now I can open URDF file with ROS MoveIt package, configure it, and generate corresponding configuration files. Now, I am watching tutorials and reading the documentation on how to use MoveIt package. I need to add a link, gripper, depth sensor, and the surrounding environment such as the table to our URDF model. Next, I will generate inverse kinematic files for both Gripper and Sensor.

      \item PE Survey: Implement features from PoseCNN, DOPE, and BayesOD. - On pause.
\end{itemize}

\section{Immediate Plans - Summer 2021:}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:

\begin{itemize}
      \item UTARI: Dr. Gans' pose and velocity estimation paper.
      \item NBV-Grasping:
      \item Pose estimation: Survey paper.
\end{itemize}

\section{Intermediate Goals - Fall 2021:}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Pose estimation: I must be finished with implementation, perhaps make some improvements, and should be working on a paper for ICRA or CVPR.
      \item Scene understanding and active learning: After pose estimation, I want to expand my research into scene understanding and active learning in the context of advanced manufacturing.
      \item ARIAC: Once I am up to speed, I will do the ARIAC workshops/tutorials and will talk to Jerry about possible contributions.
\end{itemize}
