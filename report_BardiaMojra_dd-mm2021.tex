\section{Specific Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
      \item VPQEKF: Combine QuEst and Vest with QEKF paper.
      \item Pose estimation survey.
      \item NBV-Grasping.
      \item Universal pose estimation.
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Catch up on my reading list.
  \item PVQEKF:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Replace data input to QEKF, remore IMU data with QuEst and Vest data. -- Done.
      \item Update state definition and measurement matrices. -- On going.
      \item Get ROS environment up and running. -- Next: test header include bug theory.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Pose Estimation Survey: -- On pause.
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Categorize pose estimation research and create a mind map. -- On going.
      \item Implement key point feature extraction: ORB, SIFT, SURF.
      \item Survey: I need start working on this. -- On going.
      \item Survey implementation: Classical, 2-stage, and end-to-end methods. PnP, QuEst, PVNet and else.
  \end{itemize}
  \item NBV-Grasping:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Update URDF and Xacro files for UR5e to include sensor, sensor mount (with offset), and the gripper.
      \item Add movement constraints for tables and scenes.
      \item Write two IK functions for gripper and sensor, one for each. It should plug-in with MoveIt configurator.
      \item Research and implement point-cloud data to training TensorFlow models.
      \item Learn and implement GraspIt package.
      \end{itemize}
  \item MSI Fellowship: On pause.
\end{itemize}

\section{Reading List}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Vision-based robotic grasping from object localization, object pose estimation to grasp estimation for parallel grippers - a review \cite{du2020vision} - On-going.
      \item Leveraging feature uncertainty in the pnp problem \cite{ferraz2014leveraging}.
      \item Normalized objects \cite{Wang_2019_CVPR}.
      \item Berk Calli's YCB \cite{calli2015ycb}.
      \item NASA papers \cite{NASATech44:online}.
      \item Roadmap \cite{roadmap251:online}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
      \item VPQEKF: I finished working on data visualization and handling. Next,
      I will work on re-purposing QEKF section of the code. For the ROS implementation, I think I know what the issue may be. The error says, \textit{hdf5.h} file is not found when building the Quest package. So, it might be resolved if I include the mentioned header file in the \textit{package.xml} file.

      Moreover, I read the first three chapters of \cite{escriva2019building}. It definitely helped.

      \item NBV Grasping Project: I did not work on this project this week. I will come back to this after I make more progress with VPQEKF.

      \item NASA MSI Fellowship: Need to read more NASA papers. -- On pause.
      \item PyTorch Tutorials: Transfer learning.
      \item PE Survey (On pause): I think it might be that it is not worth the time to work on a pose estimation survey paper at this point. It is too much work for a journal paper. I have gained enough knowledge and skill to implement some new idea in regards to pose estimation. I can work on this after VPQEKF paper or even after NBV-Grasping.

      \item SD Team: No update.
      \item EE Autonobots: No update.
\end{itemize}

\section{Immediate Plans - Summer 2021:}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:

\begin{itemize}
      \item UTARI: Dr. Gans' pose and velocity estimation paper.
      \item NBV-Grasping:
      \item Pose estimation: Survey paper.
\end{itemize}

\section{Intermediate Goals - Fall 2021:}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Pose estimation: I must be finished with implementation, perhaps make some improvements, and should be working on a paper for ICRA or CVPR.
      \item Scene understanding and active learning: After pose estimation, I want to expand my research into scene understanding and active learning in the context of advanced manufacturing.
      \item ARIAC: Once I am up to speed, I will do the ARIAC workshops/tutorials and will talk to Jerry about possible contributions.
\end{itemize}
