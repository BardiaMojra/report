\section{Specific Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Pose Estimation: Implement and improve.
      \item NBV-Grasping.
      \item Pose estimation survey.
      \item Universal pose estimation.
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Catch up on my reading list.
  \item Pose Estimation:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Read \cite{ma2012invitation}, up to chapter 5.
      \item Key point feature extraction: ORB, SIFT, SURF.
      \item Read VEst \cite{dani2009position}. - Done
      \item Implement QuEst in Python.
      \item Survey: I need start working on this.
      \item Evaluate various pose estimation methods: PnP, QuEst, and else.
      \item PVNet implementation: Paused. Working on a simple pose estimation for now.
  \end{itemize}
  \item NBV-Grasping:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Update URDF and Xacro files for UR5e to include sensor,
sensor mount (with offset), and the gripper.
      \item Add movement constraints for tables and scenes.
      \item Write two IK functions for gripper and sensor, one for each. It should plug-in with MoveIt configurator.
      \item Research and implement point-cloud data to training TensorFlow models.
      \item UR5e in simulation: Joe might consider.
      \item Learn and implement GraspIt package.
      \end{itemize}

  \item MSI Fellowship: On pause.
  \item Look into methods of generating uncertainty data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Reading List}
\begin{itemize}
      \item VEst \cite{dani2009position} - Done.
      \item Vision-based robotic grasping from object localization, object pose estimation to grasp estimation for parallel grippers - a review \cite{du2020vision} - On-going.
      \item NASA papers \cite{NASATech44:online}
      \item Leveraging feature uncertainty in the pnp problem \cite{ferraz2014leveraging}
      \item Berk Calli's YCB \cite{calli2015ycb}
      \item Normalized objects \cite{Wang_2019_CVPR}
      \item Roadmap \cite{roadmap251:online}
\end{itemize}

\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Pose Estimation: I am working my way through \cite{du2020vision}.
      It covers many topics in both Pose Estimation and Grasping but it does not go deep into Pose Estimation methods and could be written better. It provides a general view and I am using the information structure they provided for my survey paper. So far, I have been making annotations and taking notes.

      I read Objectron \cite{ahmadyan2020objectron} and will use their assessment of the current datasets for my survey paper.

      \item QuEst \cite{QuEst}: I still need to implement this in Python.

      \item VEst \cite{dani2009position}: I finished reading the paper and discussed it with Dr. Gans. He answered many of my questions which helps a lot.

      \item NASA MSI Fellowship: Need to read more NASA papers.

      \item PyTorch Tutorials: Transfer learning:


      \item NBV Grasping Project: I finally fixed a compilation bug that I had been working on since last week. It was preventing us from using ROS Noetic, which was a major problem. I am working URDF file now.

      \item UTARI: I will be working on my reading list, from what I received from Dr. Gans. I think he sees what I see when it comes to the importance of Lie Algebra. Our discussion helped me understand some of the differences between Essential Matrix and Homography pose estimation techniques and more.

      \item Implement features from PoseCNN, DOPE, and BayesOD. - On pause.
\end{itemize}

\section{Immediate Plans - Summer 2021:}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:

\begin{itemize}
      \item Pose estimation:
      \item NBV-Grasping:
      \item UTARI:
\end{itemize}

\section{Intermediate Goals - Fall 2021:}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Pose estimation: I must be finished with implementation, perhaps make some improvements, and should be working on a paper for ICRA or CVPR.
      \item Scene understanding and active learning: After pose estimation, I want to expand my research into scene understanding and active learning in the context of advanced manufacturing.
      \item ARIAC: Once I am up to speed, I will do the ARIAC workshops/tutorials and will talk to Jerry about possible contributions.
\end{itemize}
