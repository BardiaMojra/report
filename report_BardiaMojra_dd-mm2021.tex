\section{Specific Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
      \item VPQEKF (IROS - Mar. 1st): Work on the paper.
      \item DLO Manipulation Proposal: Work on a personal statement.
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fellowship - DLO: No update.
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Unity dataset
      \item Real dataset
      \item Develop a well-written personal statement. --- On-going.
      \item Seek other graduate fellowship opportunities. --- On-going.
      \item Develop multiple versions of research and personal statements for
      submission to different opportunities.
  \end{itemize}
  \item PVQEKF:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Read over Quest and Vest. --- Done.
      \item Write daily. --- On-going.
      \item Kitti tutorial. --- On-going.
      \item Kitti and Hilti dataset: low priority, use as control.
      \item Develop object tracking and robust-to-truncation feature.
      \item Get ROS environment up and running. I need to install Armadillo (C++) with a certain dependency configuration.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Fellowship: No update.
      \item VPQEKF: Reza, Asif, and I went over the new QEKF results. Today, we met
      again and reviewed the code with Dr. Gans. Next, I will work on setting
      up ROS environment
      for the QuEst+VEst \cite{QuEst} part of the project but I am not sure why we need to
      use ROS as it runs offline. I also initiate a push for adopting Docker
      across the board. Dr.
      Gans seemed very open-minded and we held an open discussion this morning,
      that is the reason I was late to our meeting today. Cody was not there so
      we will continue the discussion later. Moving forward, I will use docker
      for any ROS-related project. I will work on solution selection for QuEst+VEst,
      feature extraction, and the chaining step.
      \item DLO: Upon further reading, I realized that it was never my intention
      to fully simulate DLO's rather estimate their state dynamics and shape deformity efficiently and accurately. Currently, I am deriving state dynamics for an
      inverted pendulum with two degrees of freedom. My idea is to expand this
      notion to a \emph{unit segment} with 2 rotational degrees of freedom. Elastic
      rods could be considered a chain of \emph{unit segments} with identical
      properities representing an isomorphic elastic rod. Data-driven learning
      models can make clever use of physics-based simulation and constraint-satisfaction
      optimization. For example, a model could be trained on predicting largest
      unit segment while maintaining highest accuracy possible. This should result
      in increased computational efficiency as redundant segments are replaced with
      a single larger unit segment. Therefore, after the finals I will work on
      Unity tutorials and empirical dataset.
      \item NBV-Grasping Project: No update.
      \item PyTorch Tutorials: Transfer learning.
      \item Pose Estimation: I will need it for DLO segment localization.
\end{itemize}
