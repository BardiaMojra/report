\section{Specific Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Grant Proposal: Controls-Deep Learning Hybrid Systems for Industrial Cable Harnessing Applications. Focus on this for September (hard deadline).
      \item VPQEKF (IROS - Mar. 1st): Work on the paper, focus on this in October.
      \item NBV-Grasping (IROS - Mar. 1st): Work on tasks assigned by Chris, one day a week. Focus on this from November till March.
\end{itemize}

\section{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Grant Proposal: Find three scientific questions to be researched.
  \item PVQEKF:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Go over code and write matrix equations.
      \item I will go over the paper once every morning and expand sections for 30 minutes to an hour.
      \item Double-check my data prep implementation. Use KITTI Python module.
      \item Test with Hilti dataset.
      \item Add L2-norm and L2 loss features.
      \item I need to separate the state observation and control input vectors from the
      \item Develop object tracking and robust-to-truncation feature.
      \item Get ROS environment up and running. I need to install Armadillo (C++) with a certain dependency configuration.
  \end{itemize}

  \item Real-time pose estimation demo.
  \item NBV-Grasping:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Update URDF and Xacro files for UR5e to include a sensor, sensor mount (with offset), and the gripper. -- Next
      \item Add movement constraints for tables and scenes.
      \item Write two IK functions for gripper and sensor, one for each. It should plug-in with MoveIt configurator.
      \item Research and implement point-cloud data to training TensorFlow models.
      \item Learn and implement GraspIt package.
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Progress}
The following items are listed in the order of priority:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Fellowship: I updated the execution plan and made sure it contains the correct fellowship requirements. This weekend, I will remove personal material and make it available to other students in a separate repository. Perhaps, it would be forked to the lab repository.\\
      Moreover, I spent most of my time this week reading about the nature of the problem with wiring harness manufacturing. The issue seems to be a matter of manufacturing agility and increased labor costs rather than a scientific one. Dr. Gans recommended I read more into the scientific aspect of it and come up with three questions or problems to be researched for the proposal. \\
      Dr. Gans recommended I work on data-driven approaches.
      I started writing my research statement and have enough for the background paragraph. I added other notes from papers I have read so far. I will be focusing on research problem questions this week as I am still working on \cite{nguyen2021manufacturing}, \cite{dualMotionERods} and \cite{Quasi-static}.
      \item VPQEKF: I added some background material and fixed some of the errors. I haven't done much with Hilti dataset after downloading it.
      \item NBV Grasping Project: No updates.
      \item PyTorch Tutorials: Transfer learning.
      \item Pose Estimation: On pause.
      \item SD Team: No update.
      \item EE Autonobots: No update.
\end{itemize}

\section{Intermediate Goals - Fall 2021:}
\begin{itemize}
      \item QEKF: Finish paper.
      \item Active Learning.
      \item ARIAC: Once I am up to speed, I will do the ARIAC workshops/tutorials and will talk to Jerry about possible contributions.
\end{itemize}
